Warranty


Zenith Radio Corporation warrants the parts, transistors, and tubes
(including television picture tubes) in any Zenith black and white
television receiver or Zenith black and white television combination
receiver to be free from defects in material arising from normal usage.
Its obligation under this warranty is limited to replacing, or at its
option repairing any such parts or transistors or tubes of the receiver
which, after regular installation and under normal usage and service,
shall be returned within ninety (90) days (one year in case of
television picture tubes only) from the date of original consumer
purchase of the receiver to the authorized dealer from whom the purchase
was made and which shall be found to have been thus defective in
accordance with the policies established by Zenith Radio Corporation.

The obligation of Zenith Radio Corporation does not include either the
making or the furnishing of any labor in connection with the
installation of such repaired or replacement parts, transistors or tubes
nor does it include responsibility for any transportation expense.

Zenith Radio Corporation assumes no liability for failure to perform or
delay in performing its obligations with respect to the above warranty
if such failure or delay results, directly or indirectly, from any cause
beyond its control including but not limited to acts of God, acts of
government, floods, fires, shortage of materials, and labor and/or
transportation difficulties.


CONDITIONS AND EXCLUSIONS

This warranty is expressly in lieu of all other agreements and
warranties, expressed or implied, and Zenith Radio Corporation does not
authorize any person to assume for it the obligations contained in this
warranty and neither assumes nor authorizes any representative or other

 ZENITH RADIO CORPORATION                        CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60639




=NOTE:= UHF information in this book applies to models equipped for
VHF-UHF reception.


General Notes

    1. Place receiver where no bright light will fall on the screen or
    in the eyes of the viewers.

    2. Viewers should not be seated closer than a distance of 5 ft.
    from the screen for maximum comfort.

    3. Place where unimpeded cabinet ventilation is allowed. If
    receiver is to be placed along a wall allow several inches between
    wall and cabinet back. This is important for proper ventilation.


WARNING, HIGH VOLTAGE

It is recommended that only your authorized Zenith television technician
make repairs or adjustments inside the receiver. A severe shock can
result from tampering.


POWER SUPPLY

Do not attempt to operate on DC or line supplies of other voltages or
frequency ratings than those stated on the cabinet back.


CABINET STAINS

To preserve the finish on your Zenith Television cabinet, instruments or
ornaments with rubber feet should not be placed on it. The chemicals in
the rubber feet have a tendency to leave a stain.


PICTURE GLASS

Your Zenith is equipped with the new sealed picture glass and tube.
Simply clean it from the front of the set when necessary.

Use lukewarm water and a mild soap solution. Carefully wipe dry with a
clean, damp chamois cloth.




Controls


PULL-PUSH ON-OFF SWITCH--VOLUME CONTROL

To turn receiver ON, pull knob outward. To turn receiver OFF, push knob
inward. Clockwise rotation of the knob increases the volume,
counterclockwise rotation diminishes the volume.

Allow the receiver to warm up for about 1 minute before you wish to use
it.

=CHANNEL SELECTOR (VHF)=

Turn knob to channel desired.

=PERMA-SET TUNING CONTROL (VHF) NOTE:= Your Zenith has the new Perma-set
tuning control.

Each channel has been correctly set at the factory for best picture and
sound.

However, should the settings become mis-adjusted, it is a simple matter
to adjust them as follows:

    1. Turn the VHF channel selector knob to the channel number
    desired.

    2. Turn VHF perma-set tuning knob until there is no picture.

    3. Then turn perma-set tuning knob back slowly for best picture and
    sound.

    4. Repeat for each channel to be set.


TONE CONTROL

Your Zenith is equipped with a tone control which enables you to
personally select tonal values of unmatched richness and fidelity. The
high tonal register and the "bass" or low frequencies are emphasized by
turning the tone control knob. Set knob to the position most pleasing to
your ear.


UHF TUNING

First, turn VHF CHANNEL SELECTOR to "UHF" Position. Turn UHF Channel
Tuning Control for desired UHF Channel. Then carefully turn UHF Fine
Tuning knob for best picture and sound.

Disregard channel numbers 12 and 13 if they appear in the UHF indicator
dial of your unit. These are VHF channels to be tuned in with the VHF
selector.


PEAK PICTURE (SOME MODELS)

Set this control for best picture crispness in your location. The
strength of the signal being received and your personal preference for
picture detail will determine the optimum setting.


SERVICE

Your new Zenith television receiver is engineered for dependable long
life service but like any mechanical or electrical instrument, it will
occasionally require maintenance. For service consult your Zenith dealer
or refer to the organization that installed your instrument. (See
warranty.)




Picture Adjustments


BRIGHTNESS

Rotate clockwise to increase the brightness; counterclockwise reduces
the brightness. It is to be used in conjunction with the contrast
control since its movement will also have an effect on picture contrast.

[Illustration: FIG. 2]

=NOTE:= The brightness control setting for the picture shown in Figure 2
is set too high. Set the control below this level.


CONTRAST

Adjust the picture for best distinction between the black and white
shading. Your own vision is the best judge in setting this control
properly.

[Illustration: FIG. 3]

=NOTE:= The contrast control setting for the picture shown in Figure 3 is
set too high. Set the control below this level.


HORIZONTAL HOLD CONTROL

If the picture appears to have a tendency to move across the screen, or
if it assumes a broken streaked appearance, as indicated in Figure 4, it
should be readjusted to a point where the pictures remain locked in
properly on all channels.

[Illustration: FIG. 4]


VERTICAL HOLD CONTROL

This control is used in correcting for vertical movement, or rolling up
or down. Set control to lock picture. (Fig. 5)

[Illustration: FIG. 5]




Interference


The most effective means of reducing interference to a minimum has been
built into your Zenith Television receiver. Occasionally however, the
picture may be affected by electrical interference or reflections.


AUTO IGNITION AND APPLIANCES

Automobile ignition, electrical appliances, etc., cause a speckled
streaked appearing picture as shown. This condition is most noticeable
in weak signal areas. (Fig. 6.)

[Illustration: FIG. 6]


DIATHERMY

Diathermy produces a distinctive herringbone pattern and one or two
horizontal bands across the face of the picture. (Fig. 7). It can
sometimes be reduced or eliminated by the insertion of a filter trap at
the antenna terminals.

[Illustration: FIG. 7]


R.F. INTERFERENCE

Radio signals by a neighboring commercial, amateur or police station may
cause interference in the form of moving ripples or diagonal streaks.
Television or FM receivers operating near your receiver, can also be the
reason for this reaction. (Fig. 8.)

[Illustration: FIG. 8]

The insertion of a filter trap at the antenna terminals of the TV
receiver will sometimes eliminate or reduce this type of interference.




Antenna Connections


[Illustration: FIG. 9--ANTENNA CONNECTIONS AT CABINET BACK

APPROX.

TV RECEIVER]


An outdoor type antenna is recommended for best reception. If such
installation is impossible, different type indoor antenna may be used.
Quality of reception also depends upon local signal conditions.

Some models are equipped with a di-pole or mono-pole antenna mounted at
the cabinet back. To use this antenna, raise and extend rods. Vary the
length and position of the rods or rod for best picture and sound.

Under favorable receiving conditions, satisfactory reception may be
obtained with a 10 ft. length of antenna wire. (Supplied with some
models). Stretch out wire for best reception.

When using a regular outside antenna, disconnect the inside antenna
leads from the antenna terminal screws. Connect the antenna transmission
line to both of these terminal screws.


THE PROOF OF ZENITH ANTENNA SUPERIORITY IS IN THE PICTURE.

Zenith TV antennas are designed and constructed to provide you maximum
service and superior performance. Contact your Zenith dealer for the one
that will provide you with the best picture quality.


DIPLEXER

(SEE PAGE 8)

When using a combination VHF-UHF antenna system with a single
transmission line it is necessary to have an additional diplexer at the
receiver.

Make the transmission line lengths from the diplexer to the VHF and UHF
antenna post terminals on the receiver as short as possible. See your
Zenith dealer for additional information.


OSCILLATOR ADJUSTMENTS (VHF)

=NOTE:= _The VHF perma-set tuning control on the tuner is also the VHF
channel oscillator adjustment._ No additional oscillator adjustments are
incorporated. Therefore, should re-tuning of a VHF TV channel be
required, select the channel and then manually turn the tuning knob for
best picture and sound. Each individual VHF channel is tuned in this
manner.




Phonevision


A three-year commercial trial of Zenith's Phonevision[A] systems of
over-the-air subscription television has been in progress for the
Hartford, Connecticut area since June 29, 1962.

Authorized by the Federal Communications Commission, the trial has made
it possible, for the first time, for about 5000 American TV homes to
enjoy the convenience and economy of viewing top flight box-office
entertainment and other features broadcast to their home receivers.
Features at prices for the entire family no greater than a single
admission at the theatre, stadium or concert hall. The Hartford test has
already furnished factual information, rather than speculation,
concerning this brand new television service. On the basis of this
factual information, the F.C.C. has been requested to authorize
nationwide operation. If the F.C.C. is persuaded by the results of the
trial that subscription television is in the public interest and should
be authorized nationally, then every home could have its own "television
theatre" with the world's greatest and most costly entertainment offered
for an admission well below the cost of witnessing these same events
outside the home. With such premium-type programs added to entertainment
now available from sponsored television, the home viewer would be able
to obtain the ultimate of everything he wants to see on his own TV
screen.

FUSE REPLACEMENT

Remove cabinet back for access to main chassis fuse if it ever becomes
necessary to replace it.




INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR S-23427 ZENITH DIPLEXER


The diplexer is designed for use with a combined VHF-UHF antenna system
incorporating a single transmission line. Figures A, B, C, and D show
diplexer installed on various chassis models. UHF reception should be
tried with and without the inductance wire to obtain the best overall
results. Disconnect leads from previous antenna system. Install diplexer
assembly in manner most suitable to TV chassis model.

NOTE: Always connect the diplexer assembly with coil terminal to VHF
antenna terminal.
