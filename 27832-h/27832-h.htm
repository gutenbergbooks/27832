<p>Zenith Radio Corporation warrants the parts, transistors, and tubes (including television picture tubes)
in any Zenith black and white television receiver or Zenith black and white television combination receiver
to be free from defects in material arising from normal usage. Its obligation under this warranty is limited
to replacing, or at its option repairing any such parts or transistors or tubes of the receiver which, after
regular installation and under normal usage and service, shall be returned within ninety (90) days (one
year in case of television picture tubes only) from the date of original consumer purchase of the receiver
to the authorized dealer from whom the purchase was made and which shall be found to have been
thus defective in accordance with the policies established by Zenith Radio Corporation.</p>

<p>The obligation of Zenith Radio Corporation does not include either the making or the furnishing of any
labor in connection with the installation of such repaired or replacement parts, transistors or tubes nor
does it include responsibility for any transportation expense.</p>

<p>Zenith Radio Corporation assumes no liability for failure to perform or delay in performing its obligations
with respect to the above warranty if such failure or delay results, directly or indirectly, from any
cause beyond its control including but not limited to acts of God, acts of government, floods, fires,
shortage of materials, and labor and/or transportation difficulties.</p>


<p><b>CONDITIONS AND EXCLUSIONS</b></p>

<p>This warranty is expressly in lieu of all other agreements and warranties, expressed or implied, and Zenith
Radio Corporation does not authorize any person to assume for it the obligations contained in this warranty
and neither assumes nor authorizes any representative or other person to assume for it any other
liability in connection with such Zenith television receiver or parts or tubes or transistors thereof.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>1. Place receiver where no bright light will fall on
the screen or in the eyes of the viewers.</p>

<p>2. Viewers should not be seated closer than a distance
of 5 ft. from the screen for maximum
comfort.</p>

<p>3. Place where unimpeded cabinet ventilation is allowed.
If receiver is to be placed along a wall allow
several inches between wall and cabinet back.
This is important for proper ventilation.</p></div>


<p class="ltext">WARNING, HIGH VOLTAGE</p>

<p>It is recommended that only your authorized Zenith
television technician make repairs or adjustments
inside the receiver. A severe shock can result from
tampering.</p>


<p class="ltext">POWER SUPPLY</p>

<p>Do not attempt to operate on DC or line supplies
of other voltages or frequency ratings than those
stated on the cabinet back.</p>


<p class="ltext">CABINET STAINS</p>

<p>To preserve the finish on your Zenith Television
cabinet, instruments or ornaments with rubber
feet should not be placed on it. The chemicals in
the rubber feet have a tendency to leave a stain.</p>


<p class="ltext">PICTURE GLASS</p>

<p>Your Zenith is equipped with the new sealed
picture glass and tube. Simply clean it from the
front of the set when necessary.</p>

<p>Use lukewarm water and a mild soap solution.
Carefully wipe dry with a clean, damp chamois
cloth.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>


<p>However, should the settings become mis-adjusted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
it is a simple matter to adjust them as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>1. Turn the VHF channel selector knob to the
channel number desired.</p>

<p>2. Turn VHF perma-set tuning knob until there is
no picture.</p>

<p>3. Then turn perma-set tuning knob back slowly

<p>4. Repeat for each channel to be set.</p></div>


<div class="ltext">TONE CONTROL</div>

<p>Your Zenith is equipped with a tone control which
enables you to personally select tonal values of
unmatched richness and fidelity. The high tonal
register and the "bass" or low frequencies are
emphasized by turning the tone control knob. Set
knob to the position most pleasing to your ear.</p>


<div class="ltext">UHF TUNING</div>

<p>First, turn VHF CHANNEL SELECTOR to "UHF"
Position. Turn UHF Channel Tuning Control for
desired UHF Channel. Then carefully turn UHF
Fine Tuning knob for best picture and sound.</p>

<p>Disregard channel numbers 12 and 13 if they
appear in the UHF indicator dial of your unit.
These are VHF channels to be tuned in with the
VHF selector.</p>


<div class="ltext">PEAK PICTURE (SOME MODELS)</div>

<p>Set this control for best picture crispness in your
location. The strength of the signal being received
and your personal preference for picture detail
will determine the optimum setting.</p>


<div class="ltext">SERVICE</div>

<p>Your new Zenith television receiver is engineered
for dependable long life service but like any mechanical
or electrical instrument, it will occasionally
require maintenance. For service consult
your Zenith dealer or refer to the organization
that installed your instrument. (See warranty.)</p>

<p>An outdoor type antenna is recommended for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
best reception. If such installation is impossible,
different type indoor antenna may be used.
Quality of reception also depends upon local
signal conditions.</p>

<p>Some models are equipped with a di-pole or
mono-pole antenna mounted at the cabinet back.
To use this antenna, raise and extend rods. Vary
the length and position of the rods or rod for
best picture and sound.</p>

<p>Under favorable receiving conditions, satisfactory
reception may be obtained with a 10 ft. length
of antenna wire. (Supplied with some models).
Stretch out wire for best reception.</p>

<p>When using a regular outside antenna, disconnect
the inside antenna leads from the antenna terminal
screws. Connect the antenna transmission
line to both of these terminal screws.</p>


<p class="ltext" style="font-weight: normal;">THE PROOF OF ZENITH ANTENNA SUPERIORITY
IS IN THE PICTURE.</p>

<p>Zenith TV antennas are designed and constructed
to provide you maximum service and
superior performance. Contact your Zenith dealer
for the one that will provide you with the best
picture quality.</p>


<p class="ltext">DIPLEXER</p>

<p>(SEE PAGE 8)</p>

<p>When using a combination VHF-UHF antenna
system with a single transmission line it is necessary
to have an additional diplexer at the receiver.</p>

<p>Make the transmission line lengths from the diplexer
to the VHF and UHF antenna post terminals
on the receiver as short as possible. See your
Zenith dealer for additional information.</p>


<div class="ltext">OSCILLATOR ADJUSTMENTS (VHF)</div>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> <i>The VHF perma-set tuning control on the
tuner is also the VHF channel oscillator adjustment.</i>
No additional oscillator adjustments are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
incorporated. Therefore, should re-tuning of a
VHF TV channel be required, select the channel
and then manually turn the tuning knob for best
picture and sound. Each individual VHF channel
is tuned in this manner.</p>

<p>A three-year commercial trial of Zenith's Phonevision<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
systems of over-the-air subscription television
has been in progress for the Hartford, Connecticut
area since June 29, 1962.</p>

<p>Authorized by the Federal Communications Commission,
the trial has made it possible, for the
first time, for about 5000 American TV homes to
enjoy the convenience and economy of viewing
top flight box-office entertainment and other features
broadcast to their home receivers. Features
at prices for the entire family no greater than a
single admission at the theatre, stadium or concert
hall. The Hartford test has already furnished
factual information, rather than speculation, concerning
this brand new television service. On the
basis of this factual information, the F.C.C. has
been requested to authorize nationwide operation.
If the F.C.C. is persuaded by the results of the
trial that subscription television is in the public
interest and should be authorized nationally, then
every home could have its own "television
theatre" with the world's greatest and most costly
entertainment offered for an admission well below
the cost of witnessing these same events outside
the home. With such premium-type programs
added to entertainment now available from sponsored
television, the home viewer would be able
to obtain the ultimate of everything he wants to
see on his own TV screen.</p>
